## Branching Strategy: <br>
When you want to work with this repo, please create your own Branch first.
This way we dont accidentally overwrite each other. <br>

### This is how to create your branch in Github Desktop: <br>

### The workflow called Feature Branching or GitHub Flow goes like this: <br>
We work on some feature on our branch, then we commit and push it, and after that
we change to the main branch and merge our branch into the main branch.
Github also wants to pull all the other changes into your local main now. 
This way you have all the changes that the others made, and vice versa.
If two or more people worked on the same line of code, we get a merge conflict, and can manually
decide which version we want to use further on.
After that you want to go back to your branch again and merge main into your branch (or go to 'Branch' -> 'Update from main'), so your branch is also up to date.
Then you can begin to work on the next feature. <br>
